Yet another fucking d{ashboard,aemon}

#### What for
Our problems were not solved by existing tools we knew of. And we needed more dev practice. So we've started this one. IDK, what option is more important. You read the code and decide.

#### Installation

TODO:
[ ] Write scripts/setup/install.py

1. virtualenv <venvdir>
2. source <venvdir>/bin/activate
3. pip install -f scripts/setup/requirements.txt
4. run scripts/show_dashboard.sh // it exports flask app name and runs the dashboard in browser
